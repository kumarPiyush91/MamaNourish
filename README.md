This application is designed to support pregnant women by providing essential health and nutrition insights throughout pregnancy.  Users can enter their weight, height, and month of pregnancy, and the app calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI). Based on this information, the app also provides a daily nutrient requirement chart, helping users understand how much nutrition they need at each stage of pregnancy.
